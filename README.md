This repository contains a GitHub Action specialized for building DPF-based audio plugins that use CMake as their build system.

It supports:

- building Linux, macOS and Windows in various architectures
- perform plugin validation for all formats supported by DPF, including run-time memory checks
- upload "nightly" artifact archives for each build
- upload release archives

## Template setup

The latest recommended setup is:

```yaml
jobs:
  linux:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [linux-arm64, linux-armhf, linux-i686, linux-riscv64, linux-x86_64]
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: distrho/dpf-cmake-action@v1
        with:
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}

  macos:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [macos-intel, macos-universal]
    runs-on: macos-11
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: distrho/dpf-cmake-action@v1
        with:
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}

  windows:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        target: [win32, win64]
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: distrho/dpf-cmake-action@v1
        with:
          target: ${{ matrix.target }}

  pluginval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: distrho/dpf-cmake-action@v1
        with:
          target: pluginval
```
